## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 19.2
- Axios for API calls
- Context API for state management
- CSS3 for styling

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- Bcrypt for password hashing

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Open `server/.env` file
   - Update `MONGODB_URI` with your MongoDB connection string
   - Update `JWT_SECRET` with a secure secret key

4. Start MongoDB (if running locally):
```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB

# macOS/Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the root directory (if you're in server folder):
```bash
cd ..
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

### For Everyone (No Login Required)

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
2. Browse all available recipes
3. Use search and filters to find specific recipes
4. Click **View Recipe** to see full details

```

**Or using cURL:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","email":"admin@example.com","password":"admin123","role":"admin"}'
```
